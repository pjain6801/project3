    <div class="project-content">
      <h2 class="section-heading">Project 1: Commmunication Design (Incyte)</h2>
      <h3 class="section-subheading">Project Overview</h3>
        <p class="content"> Our client, Incyte, is a global biopharmaceutical that is conducting a clinical trial for treating Vitiligo. 
        Our team created a machine learning algorithm for the client that will use Vitiligo patients' skin photos to provide 
        patients feedback on their condition.
          <br><br>
        Our team was brought in for 2 major reasons:</p>
       <p class="content"> 1) Create a brochure which will be distributed to Vitiligo patients encouraging them to take pictures of their skin. 
          <br> 2) Create an app for the patients to take those pictures and help them track their condition improvements.</p>
      <h3 class="section-subheading">Design Principles</h3>

      <div class="principles-grid">
        <div class="principle1">
          <h4 class="principle-heading">Information Hierarchy:</h4>
          <p class="content">‍In addition to being provided with informational content for the brochure, I also generated content through doing company research. 
            I thought of this brochure as a information architecture design problem. I structured pieces of information as bullet points and small paragraphs to 
            make it easily consumable to readers and utilized white space to break up the content visually on the page. It was an iterative process to design the 
            information in the most effective way for consumption.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle2">
          <h4 class="principle-heading">Progressive Disclosure:</h4>
          <p class="content">The organizational structure of of a brochure fully embraces the importance of progressive disclosure. I took advantage of the brochure 
            format by putting a 'hook' statement on the front page. After the reader opens the pamphlet, their eyes would be drawn to the the numbers written with 
            a pop of purple. The color contrast and surrounding white space will catch the readers attention as they navigate the content. </p>

      <h3 class="section-subheading">App Design</h3>
      <p class="content"> I was then tasked to create mid-fidelity screens of a patient-facing app to help patients track improvements in their skin conditions. 
        This app includes features of finding a doctor, chatting with a doctor, and reviewing patient's improvement.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Project 2: Mobile App Design</h2>
      <h3 class="section-subheading">Project Overview</h3>
      <p class="content">This client, Mclane Xpress, is an online wholesaler company. In effort to sign them on, I created initial screens of what their mobile 
        app could look like if they worked with us. I created a mobile app design based on their desktop website to ensure consistency with their design system. 
        I added a scanner feature that would be used by their employees and improve their workflow efficiency.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Project 3: Data Dashboard Design</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Project Overview</h3>
         <p class="content">Our client, Genmab, is an international biotechnology company that wanted to create a dashboard interface for all their employees. 
          After speaking to multiple stakeholders, I learned that they wanted a website where all of the software and applications their employees use could be 
          in one place with a single sign-on feature. I also learned that website would have an employee and admin functionality. In the admin side, they would 
          be given control over adding or editing applications, user management and adding updates or announcements.</p>
  
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Design Principles</h3>
        <div class="principles-grid">
          <div class="principle1">
            <h4 class="principle-heading">Information Hierarchy:</h4>
            <p class="content">‍‍I worked with the design team in the ideation process of designing the screens. I branched out off their designs with slight 
              modifications to present to our client. I created a top navigation bar so the user can easily access all the apps. On the right I made a calendar 
              feature for the user to stay on top of upcoming meetings. The rest of the screen displays snapshots of important data that's relevant to the user.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="principle2">
            <h4 class="principle-heading">Consistent Design Identity:</h4>
            <p class="content">I also made sure to use a consistent design identity for both versions of the interface, but enough contrast so that the admin and 
              employee versions are different. </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Project 4: Communication Design (Mobile Programming)</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Project Overview</h3>
         <p class="content">I was tasked to create a multi-page pamphlet about our company. The purpose of the pamphlet was to replace slide decks which were used 
          in meetings with new clients. My goal was to create an overall pamphlet structure that breaks down three things: who we are, what services we provide, 
          and why should potential clients choose us. After the main pamphlet was made, I was then tasked to create additional pamphlets that were centered around 
          our industries of expertise, for example Healthcare, Banking and Finance, and Pharma.</p>

          <h3 class="section-subheading">Design Principles</h3>
          <div class="principles-grid">
            <div class="principle1">
              <h4 class="principle-heading">Emphasis:</h4>
              <p class="content">‍‍I created emphasis by using geometric lines and shapes to draw the user's attention towards information. For example, the first 
                page has a hang reaching up to the clouds, which carry two chunks of content. The color contrast between different parts of the page also helps put 
                emphasis.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="principle2">
              <h4 class="principle-heading">Pattern:</h4>
              <p class="content">I used different spatial forms in the same way to create a pattern. For example, the repeated use of hexagonal icons adds variety 
                to the page, sparking the readers' interest towards that content. I also used the color pattern of grey and blue hroughout the pamphlet. </p>
