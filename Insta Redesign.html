                <h3 class="section-subheading">Challenges</h3>
                    <p class="content">While using Spotify, I noticed that there was no feature that allows you to mix multiple playlists. Users have to switch 
                        between playlists manually. They cannot simply shuffle multiple playlists to suit their listening preferences at a given time. </p> 
                 <h3 class="section-subheading">Objective</h3>
                    <p class="content">1. Re-design Instagram to be more inclusive
                    <br> 2. Ignite an engaging experience</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Research Questions</h3>
                    <p class="content">What are current attitudes towards Instagram?
                    <br> Which features do users currently use on Instagram?</p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Research Method</h3>
                    <p class="content">I decided to use a survey as our research method because it is the best medium to use when asking Instagram users questions. 
                        Also my research questions will create multiple choice and short responses rather than detailed and open-ended responses.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Key Findings</h3>
                    <p class="content">The research shows that participants that rated their contentedness lower than 6 mostly found Instagram boring or negative. 
                        23 of the 30 participants use direct messaging at least once a week. IGTV, likes/comments, and direct messaging were the least favorite 
                        features.
                        <br><br>
                        It was evident there was scope for re-designing certain parts of Instagram to create a more engaging and positive experience.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Screens</h2>
                <div class="screen-grid">
                    <div class="screen1">
                      <img src="..//project4/img/Insta Redesign - Feed Screen.png" alt="Insta Old & Current Feed Screen Pic">
                    </div>
                    <div class="screen-blurb">
                      <h3 class="screen-name">Feed Screen</h3>
                      <p class="content">Based on the research, most users did not favor likes. The concept of likes also creates a competitive environment between 
                        users, where their focus shifts from enjoying their friend's posts to beating their friend's likes. To decrease this negative competition I 
                        designed a Feed Page where the number of likes a post has is private.Â The user that has posted the content can still see how many people 
                        liked their content, however, others cannot see this information.</p>

                      <h3 class="screen-name">Commenting/DM Screen</h3>
                      <p class="content">When a user decides to comment on a post, it brings them to their direct messages with that user. This change in the 
                        feature will allow for more private and authentic conversations to take place rather than short public comments such as "nice pic". This 
                        will overall improve users' feeling towards Instagram from boring, fake, and a waste of time to engaging and fun.</p>

                      <p class="content">According to my research, most users value their mutual friends. The follower/ following count can also cause an unhealthy 
                        competition between users. Therefore, I deleted the follower/ following count and replaced it with a mutual friends count because my 
                        research suggested people follow others based on mutual friends.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Usability Testing</h2>
                      <p class="content">After conducting usability testing with 8 Spotify users, I found two usability issues that I fixed. One issue was that the 
                        'select' button was hard for users to locate. Therefore, I made the button larger and changed the color to increase contrast.
                      <br><br>The second problem was that when users selected a playlist, they tried to click on the title, album, or blank space. Therefore, I made it 
                      all clickable to create a user-friendly experience.</p>
